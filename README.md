# PDF_RECYCLERVIEW_DOWNLOAD_PDFVIEW

It is an simple application which lists the PDF form the database.

[note: The database contains the pdf download links]

The pdfs are listed using recyclerview

The selected PDF is downloaded and viewed using barteksc's AndroidPDFViewer repository
https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer

I have inserted 1 second delay before viewing the pdf [this is a buggy algorithm] so if the pdf file is too large the download time may go more than 1 second and results in failure!!!

I will update My code once the bug is solved!!!
